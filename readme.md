# Scientific Calculator

This project is a Java-based scientific calculator. It's built using Apache Ant, a Java library and command-line tool that helps in driving processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The calculator is designed to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations.

## Code Overview

The main class `calculator_app` extends `javax.swing.JFrame`, indicating that this is a Swing-based GUI application. Swing is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java. This makes it platform-independent and lightweight.

The class contains several private variables to keep track of the current number (`num`), the current text (`txt`), and a draft string (`draft`). These variables are used to manage the state of the calculator and to store intermediate results of calculations.

The calculator also uses a `HashMap` to map characters to integers (`opr`). This is likely used to represent the precedence of different operators in mathematical expressions. For example, in the constructor of the class, the character '=' is mapped to the integer 0, which might indicate that '=' is considered an operator with the lowest precedence.

In addition, the class uses two `Stack` objects, `operations` and `operands`. These are stacks of stacks of characters and doubles, respectively. These data structures are likely used to parse and evaluate the mathematical expressions entered by the user. The `operations` stack probably stores the operators in the current expression, while the `operands` stack stores the numerical operands.

The class also contains several boolean flags and integer counters, such as `empty_flag`, `opr_flag`, `end_flag`, `func_flag`, `end_bracket`, `decimal_flag`, `bracket_flag`, and `func_count`. These are used to manage the state of the calculator and to track various aspects of the parsing and evaluation process. 
- `num`: This variable is used to store the current number that the user has input or the result of a calculation. It's a double-precision floating-point number, which allows it to hold very large (or small) numbers with a high degree of precision.

- `txt`: This is a `String` variable that holds the current text displayed on the calculator's screen. It could be a number, an expression, or a message to the user.

- `draft`: This `String` variable is used to store a draft of the current expression. It's used when the user is in the middle of typing an expression and hasn't yet hit the equals button to calculate the result.

- `opr`: This is a `HashMap` that maps `Character` keys to `Integer` values. It's used to represent the precedence of different operators in mathematical expressions. For example, the character '=' might be mapped to the integer 0, indicating that '=' is considered an operator with the lowest precedence.

- `operations`: This is a `Stack` of `Stack<Character>` objects. It's used to store the operators in the current expression. The use of a stack of stacks allows the calculator to handle nested expressions correctly.

- `operands`: This is a `Stack` of `Stack<Double>` objects. It's used to store the numerical operands in the current expression. Like `operations`, the use of a stack of stacks allows the calculator to handle nested expressions.

- `empty_flag`: This boolean flag is used to indicate whether the current expression is empty. It's likely set to `true` when the calculator is cleared or after a calculation is completed.

- `opr_flag`: This boolean flag is used to indicate whether the last character entered was an operator. This could be used to prevent the user from entering two operators in a row.

- `end_flag`: This boolean flag is used to indicate whether the current operation is complete. It's likely set to `true` after the user hits the equals button and the result is calculated.

- `func_flag`: This boolean flag is used to indicate whether a function is being used. It's likely set to `true` when the user starts typing a function name.

- `end_bracket`: This boolean flag is used to indicate whether a closing bracket is expected. It's likely set to `true` when the user types an opening bracket and set to `false` when they type a closing bracket.

The constructor `calculator_app()` initializes the `opr` HashMap and sets up the GUI. This involves creating the buttons for the calculator and setting up the layout of the GUI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
